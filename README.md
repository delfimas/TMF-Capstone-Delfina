# Master's Final Project: Data Science and Artificial Intelligence

This repository contains the final project for the Master's program in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. The project is divided into two main parts: preliminary data analysis and machine learning techniques.

## Preliminary Data Analysis

In this section of the project, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the dataset to gain insights into its structure, quality, and potential patterns. Key steps in this analysis include:

- Data preprocessing: Cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistical summaries to understand the distribution and relationships within the data.
- Descriptive statistics: Calculating key metrics to describe the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the data.

## Machine Learning Techniques

The second part of the project focuses on the application of various machine learning algorithms to the dataset to solve a specific problem or achieve a particular objective. This section includes:

- Model selection: Choosing appropriate algorithms based on the nature of the problem and the characteristics of the data.
- Model training: Training the selected models using the preprocessed data.
- Model evaluation: Assessing the performance of the models through metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Hyperparameter tuning: Fine-tuning the model parameters to improve performance.
